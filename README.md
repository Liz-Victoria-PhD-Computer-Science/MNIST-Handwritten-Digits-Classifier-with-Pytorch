# MNIST-Handwritten-Digits-Classifier-with-Pytorch
For this project I preprocessed a dataset for handwritten digit recognition, built a neural network, then trained and tuned that neural network using data. This is the MNIST Handwritten Digits Classifier with Pytorch. This is part of the AWS &amp; Udacity "AWS ML Fundamentals" Certification.
